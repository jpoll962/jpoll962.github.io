## About
I am a Computer Engineering and Economics (with a minor in Mathematics) student at Utah State University (USU). I plan to graduate in the Spring of 2023.
This GitHub account contains work I have done in my leisure time and work I completed for classes.

Below are some of the many links that I have found throughout my semesters in college.
Most of them are links that helped me learn different topics or helped me prepare for a career in Investment Banking. Some of them
are links I used to kill time. Many of them will be links to more links. It is an endless rabbit hole of resources.

If you know of any other amazing resources I can add (even ones that don't go in the below categories), don't hesitate to reach out to me at jpoll962@yahoo.com! Enjoy!
